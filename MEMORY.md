# wh — project memory

Persistent context for this project. Kept **in-repo** (versioned with the code)
and deliberately **separate from the shared client-project memory** at
`~/.claude/projects/-opt-projects/memory/`. Read this + `README.md` +
`tools/README.md` when resuming.

## What this is
A Warhammer 40,000 (11th ed.) force-disposition + list tool for the armies
jbeddoe plays (currently **Imperial Knights**), to optimise list building and
guide practice. Python, plain-YAML data, stdlib CLI (`PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wh …`),
PyYAML the only dep.

## Status (2026-07-22)
- All 8 IK detachments complete: DP, disposition, full rule/enhancements/
  stratagems, enhancement points.
- 22 datasheets with MFM points (1st-copy / each-2nd+-copy escalating, + wargear).
- Full profiles (stats/weapons/abilities) for the 10 faction-pack datasheets
  (Destrier + Imperial Armour knights) in `data/profiles/imperial-knights.yaml`,
  hand-transcribed from the PDF. Moirax conversion beam cannon flagged `verify`.
- CLI: `dispositions, matrix, matchup, spread, detachments, show, points, profile, plan, build`.
- **List builder** (`build`) validates DP=3, unique-group, disposition legality,
  enhancement ownership/dupes, Rule of Three (max 3/datasheet), points budget;
  costs with escalating pricing.
- Tests: `python3 tests/test_data.py` + `python3 tests/test_army.py` (both green).

## Non-obvious facts / gotchas
- "Force disposition" is the formal 11e mission mechanic (5 dispositions → 5×5
  asymmetric matrix → each player's mission), NOT an archetype concept.
- **Data sources** (full detail in `tools/README.md`):
  - gdmissions.app: matrix in page HTML; disposition/mission cards are PNGs.
  - 39k.pro: whole dataset embedded in its Vite JS bundle (string-aware parser
    in `tools/extract.py`); predates the faction pack; NO usable points.
  - **MFM is authoritative** for points AND for detachment→DP→disposition. Needs
    a browser UA (else 403). Unit/detachment names stream in client-side (not in
    raw SSR HTML) — points ride in `<div hidden id="S:N">` suspense payloads so
    `tools/gen_points.py` works off the raw fetch, but re-scraping the
    detachment→disposition mapping would need a rendered DOM.
  - 39k gave two STALE dispositions (Freeblade→Priority Assets, Gate Warden→
    Take and Hold were corrected); trust MFM / user over 39k.

## TODO
- Practice layer: disposition/mission scoring rules (from gdmissions Missions
  section) → what to drill per disposition.
- Codex datasheet profiles: faction-pack 10 are done; the core Codex knights
  (Paladin/Crusader/Castellan/etc.) have points but no profile (not in the pack).
- Mathhammer (expected damage / kill odds) now feasible from the profiles.
